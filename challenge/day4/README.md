# Day 4 - Recursion

Recursion can be a perplexing concept to wrap your head around so don't be discouraged if you don't get it straightaway.

Recursion is when a function calls itself with a smaller output. So while an iterative function will make use of for loop and while loop, a recursive function achieves this by calling itself
until a base case is reached.

> Recursive function have two parts:
> 1. The base case
> 2. The functional calling itself with a different input
> There are two types of recursion, one-branch and two-branch.
